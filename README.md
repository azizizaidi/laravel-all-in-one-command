```

The package will automatically register itself via Laravel's package discovery.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Generate a complete feature with the interactive command:

```bash
php artisan make:feature Order
```

This will prompt you to choose which components to generate:

- Model
- Migration
- Factory
- Seeder
- Controller (Resource/Invokable/Basic)
- Form Requests (Store/Update)
- Service Class with optional Interface
- Web Routes
- API Routes
- Tests (Unit/Feature)
- Policy
- Scheduled Task Command
- Blade Views (CRUD)

### Example Output

When you run `php artisan make:feature Order`, the command will generate:

```
app/Models/Order.php
database/migrations/2024_01_01_000000_create_orders_table.php
database/factories/OrderFactory.php
database/seeders/OrderSeeder.php
app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php
app/Http/Requests/StoreOrderRequest.php
app/Http/Requests/UpdateOrderRequest.php
app/Services/OrderService.php

tests/Feature/OrderTest.php
resources/views/orders/index.blade.php
resources/views/orders/create.blade.php

```

### Advanced Usage

#### Custom Namespaces

You can specify custom controller namespaces:

```bash
php artisan make:feature Shop/Product
```

This will create controllers in `App\Http\Controllers\Shop\` namespace.
